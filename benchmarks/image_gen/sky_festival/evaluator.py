Sky Festival evaluator — GPT-5 LLM-as-a-judge.

Scores VLM-generated images against a 100-point rubric using GPT-5 vision.
Returns combined_score normalized to [0, 1].

The framework passes the image path via a sidecar file:
    <program_path>.image_path  ->  absolute path to the generated image

Requirements:
    pip install openai

You are an extremely strict image evaluation judge. You score images against a precise rubric.
You must output ONLY valid JSON with the exact keys specified. No markdown, no explanation outside JSON.
Be harsh — most AI-generated images fail these criteria. Award points only when clearly met.
If you cannot verify a requirement (e.g., too small to see), award 0 for that item."""

RUBRIC_PROMPT = """\
Score this image against the following rubric for a "Floating Sky Festival" scene.
Be extremely strict. Only award points when requirements are CLEARLY and UNAMBIGUOUSLY met.

## Category 1: Cloud Counting and Shapes (15 pts)
- Exactly 9 clouds visible in the sky: 5 pts (8 or 10 clouds = 0)

## Category 2: Hot Air Balloons — Count, Colors, and Passengers (20 pts)
- Exactly 5 hot air balloons visible: 4 pts (4 or 6 = 0)
- Each balloon has correct distinct color/pattern (red-striped, yellow-dotted, rainbow, purple-stars, green-peace-sign): 6 pts (deduct 2 per wrong/missing pattern)
- Correct passenger count per balloon (2 children, 1 woman, 3 cats, 1 violinist, empty): 6 pts (deduct 2 per wrong count)
- Banner on Balloon 5 reads exactly "HAPPY 100TH SKY FESTIVAL": 4 pts (any word wrong = 0)

## Category 3: Floating Island and Trees (10 pts)
- Floating island visible suspended in air: 3 pts
- Exactly 4 different trees on the island: 4 pts (3 or 5 = 0)
- Trees in correct order left to right (oak, cherry blossom, palm, pine): 3 pts

## Category 4: Party Table Items — Counting and Arrangement (20 pts)
- 3-tier cake with candle present: 3 pts
- Cake text "100 YEARS" legible on middle tier: 3 pts
- Exactly 6 cupcakes in 2 rows of 3 with different colored frostings: 4 pts
- Lemonade pitcher with 3 lemon slices and 2 ice cubes: 3 pts
- Stack of exactly 8 golden plates: 3 pts
- Exactly 5 gift boxes in pyramid (3 bottom, 2 top): 4 pts

## Category 5: Characters — Count, Identity, and Details (15 pts)
- Exactly 6 characters seated at the table (3 per side): 5 pts
- Correct characters identifiable (girl with pigtails, penguin with bowtie, giraffe, robot, grandmother, golden retriever): 5 pts (1 pt per correct character, max 5 — giraffe counts as 1 even if neck extends)
- Specific details: robot has 3 colored buttons on chest, grandmother thumbs-up with LEFT hand, dog wears striped party hat, girl has 5 fingers per hand: 5 pts (deduct 1.5 per missing detail)

## Category 6: Decorations and Flying Creatures (10 pts)
- Bunting banner with approximately 11 flags in alternating red/yellow/blue: 3 pts
- Exactly 7 paper lanterns in different colors: 3 pts
- Correct flying creatures: 4 birds (blue jay, cardinal, canary, hummingbird) + 2 butterflies (monarch, morpho): 4 pts (1 pt per 2 correct creatures)

- What is the goal or objective? (maximize, minimize, optimize)
- What are the inputs and outputs?
- What needs to be improved? (variables/decisions that affect the goal)
- What constraints exist?

**STEP 1: Analyze the Evaluator Code**
- How are solutions scored?
- What metrics are computed?
- What causes failures or penalties?

**STEP 2: Identify Metrics**
- What is the primary metric or Pareto objective set?
- How is it calculated?
- What secondary metrics exist?
- If variance/std is penalized, the program needs consistency across scenarios

**STEP 3: Identify Constraints**
- What conditions must be satisfied?
- What validation happens?
- What causes score penalties?

**STEP 4: Identify Problem Structure**
- Is processing sequential or global?
- Are decision variables discrete or continuous?
- What dependencies exist between decisions?
- **CRITICAL:** What data does your program receive vs what the evaluator uses?
- **CRITICAL:** How are metrics computed across components? Independently then aggregated, or jointly?

**STEP 5: Determine Appropriate Approach**
- Match approach to problem structure
- Consider what has worked vs failed before
- Identify promising library/technique combinations

**STEP 6: Identify Improvement Opportunities**
- What would increase each metric?
- What would satisfy constraints better?
- What fundamentally different approaches could work?

- What text/labels must appear in the image?
- What spatial relationships are specified?

**STEP 1: Analyze the Evaluation Rubric**
- How is the image scored? (read the evaluator code)
- What categories/dimensions are evaluated?
- What specific counts, colors, positions does the judge look for?
- What causes low scores in each category?

**STEP 2: Identify Weakest Categories**
- Which rubric categories score lowest in the current best?
- Which elements are consistently missing or wrong?
- Which details does the image model struggle with most?

**STEP 3: Understand Image Model Limitations**
- Image models struggle with: exact counts, legible text, precise spatial layouts
- Image models are good at: mood, color, style, general composition, prominent objects
- Which required elements hit model limitations?

**STEP 4: Analyze Current Prompt Structure**
- How is the prompt organized? (single block vs sections vs enumerated)
- Does it emphasize the right things? (models weight early text more heavily)
- Are critical details buried or prominent?
- Is the prompt too long or too short?

**STEP 5: Identify Prompt Engineering Strategies**
- What structural changes could help? (reordering, sectioning, emphasis)
- What description strategies could improve counts? (explicit enumeration, spatial anchoring)
- What style/medium changes might help with specific elements?

**STEP 6: Prioritize Improvements**
- Which categories have the most room for improvement?
- Which improvements are achievable given model limitations?
- What prompt changes would have the highest impact?

- **Structural mismatch:** Wrong approach for problem structure (e.g., linear proxy for non-linear objective) -> use approaches that match the actual structure
- **Implementation issues:** If the same library failed multiple times or very badly (>10% decrease), it likely indicates a fundamental mismatch - suggest a different class of approaches"""

**Note:** Standard scientific libraries (scipy, numpy, etc.) are available. PyTorch and TensorFlow are not available.

**For Continuous Optimization with Constraints:**
- scipy.optimize.minimize with constraint handling (SLSQP, trust-constr)
- Multiple initial guesses for global optimization
- Geometric approaches (Voronoi, convex hull)

**For Discrete/Combinatorial Problems:**
- Greedy heuristics with good ordering
- Local search (swaps, moves)
- scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment for assignment problems
- scipy.optimize.linprog for linear constraints

**For Graph/Network Problems:**
- NetworkX algorithms (shortest path, min spanning tree, flow)
- Spectral methods (eigenvalue-based ordering)

**For Repair/Reconstruction:**
- Heuristic-based detection and correction
- Structural constraint exploitation
- Averaging/interpolation for consistency

**For Robust Filtering/Noise Reduction:**
- scipy.signal (medfilt, savgol_filter, wiener) for direct filtering
- Use methods that handle outliers better than mean-based (median, percentile)
- Do NOT use scipy.optimize.minimize to tune filter parameters
- Use filtering functions directly, not multi-stage optimization

**General Principles:**
- Prefer single-function library calls over multi-stage pipelines
- Match algorithm to problem structure
- Simple approaches with good heuristics often beat complex methods

## ANTI-PATTERNS - Critical rules about what NOT to do

1. **Do NOT use multi-stage optimization**: Do NOT call one function then optimize its output. Deterministic setup code followed by a single optimization call is allowed.

2. **Do NOT use scipy.optimize.minimize for hyperparameter tuning**: Use minimize to solve the problem directly, NOT to tune parameters for another function.

3. **Do NOT use scipy.optimize.minimize for discrete problems**: Continuous optimizers cannot handle discrete constraint violations properly.

4. **Each idea MUST be a single-function library call**: Do NOT suggest multi-stage processing (e.g., "call A then call B").

**AVOID:** DEAP, genetic algorithm libraries, domain-specific complex libraries, custom research algorithms, or any library requiring additional `pip install`

**Learning from Success:**
When an approach succeeds, think: what principle made it work? Learn and think of better ideas, don't just add complexity. If breakthrough patterns are known, prioritize approaches that match them.

## DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS

Before generating ideas, explicitly think:
- Idea 1: [Type A - e.g., algorithmic refinement or library-based approach]
- Idea 2: [Type B - e.g., structural change or processing pattern - DIFFERENT from A]
- Idea 3: [Type C - e.g., different technique or optimization method - DIFFERENT from A and B]

**Verify:** Are these DIFFERENT types? NOT variations of the same approach.

Each idea must:
- Use DIFFERENT libraries/techniques than failed attempts
- Target DIFFERENT metrics/aspects from the evaluator
- Be independently implementable
- Prefer clear implementations (different != more complex)

### Be Specific and Actionable

Not vague: "Try optimization"
Specific: "Use scipy.optimize.minimize with SLSQP method"

- Include exact library names, function names, methods, parameters
- Provide step-by-step implementation guide
- Focus on core logic that implements the idea correctly
- Handle edge cases and avoid errors/warnings
- For optimization: use multiple initializations, appropriate iteration counts and convergence criteria (evaluation timeout: {self.eval_timeout}s)"""

        """Build image-specific techniques guidance section."""
        return """## Prompt Engineering Techniques for Image Generation

**For Improving Object Counts & Specificity:**
- Explicit enumeration: number and describe each instance ("the first balloon is red with stripes, the second balloon is blue with dots, the third...")
- Spatial anchoring: place objects at specific locations ("in the top-left corner", "at the center")
- Grid/layout descriptions: describe the scene as zones or a grid
- Repetition emphasis: mention critical counts multiple times

**For Improving Spatial Arrangement:**
- Layered composition: describe background, midground, foreground separately
- Directional flow: describe the scene left-to-right or top-to-bottom
- Relative positioning: define objects in relation to each other ("to the right of X, below Y")
- Scene sectioning: divide the image into named regions and populate each

**For Improving Text/Labels in Images:**
- Prominent placement: make text elements the primary focus of a region
- Sign/banner framing: describe text on clear, high-contrast surfaces
- Simplify text: shorter text is more reliably rendered
- Style emphasis: "clearly legible text reading exactly..."

**For Improving Detail Accuracy:**
- Category isolation: dedicate a paragraph to each evaluation category
- Attribute chaining: attach all required attributes directly to each object
- Checklist-style: explicitly list each required detail as a bullet

**For Changing Overall Approach:**
- Art style shifts: try different mediums (digital painting, 3D render, illustration, watercolor)
- Perspective changes: bird's eye view, isometric, close-up vs wide shot
- Simplification: reduce scene complexity to improve accuracy on key elements
- Narrative framing: describe the scene as a story moment for better coherence

**ANTI-PATTERNS - What NOT to suggest:**
1. Do NOT suggest code/algorithmic approaches (scipy, numpy, ML training) - this is prompt engineering
2. Do NOT suggest using different image models - work with the current model
3. Do NOT suggest post-processing or image editing - only prompt changes
4. Do NOT suggest vague ideas like "make it better" - be specific about prompt structure changes

**General Principles:**
- Image models weight text at the beginning of prompts more heavily
- Fewer, more specific constraints are better than many vague ones
- Concrete visual descriptions beat abstract concepts
- Structural prompt changes (reordering, sectioning) often help more than adding words"""

**Reasoning & Decomposition:**
- Chain-of-thought: "Think step by step before answering"
- Multi-hop decomposition: "First identify relevant facts, then reason across them"
- Self-verification: "Check your answer against the passages before responding"
- Contrastive reasoning: "Consider why other answers might be wrong"

**Instruction Structure:**
- Role assignment: Give the LLM a specific expert persona
- Task decomposition: Break complex tasks into sub-steps within the prompt
- Explicit constraints: "Answer ONLY based on provided passages"
- Output format specification: "Respond with just the answer, no explanation"

**Few-Shot & Examples:**
- Include 1-3 worked examples showing input->reasoning->output
- Show examples of common error patterns and correct handling
- Demonstrate edge cases (unanswerable, ambiguous)

**Retrieval-Augmented Strategies:**
- Passage prioritization: "Focus on passages most relevant to the question"
- Evidence extraction: "Quote the specific evidence before answering"
- Multi-passage synthesis: "Combine information from multiple passages"

**Error Prevention:**
- Hallucination guards: "Only use information from the given passages"
- Confidence calibration: "If unsure, state the most likely answer"
- Format enforcement: "Your answer must be a short phrase, not a sentence"

**General Principles:**
- Be specific over generic — vague prompts lead to vague answers
- Structure matters — numbered steps outperform wall-of-text instructions
- Constraints prevent errors — explicit "do not" rules reduce hallucination
- Less can be more — overly long prompts can confuse the LLM

## ANTI-PATTERNS for Prompt Optimization

1. **Do NOT just rephrase the same instruction** — changing words without changing strategy is not a breakthrough
2. **Do NOT add irrelevant constraints** — constraints should target observed failure modes
3. **Do NOT make the prompt excessively long** — diminishing returns after a certain length
4. **Do NOT add examples that don't match the task** — misleading examples hurt performance
